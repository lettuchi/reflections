How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It will help determine the location of the error, and what else may have been changed that effected that error.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can use code that worked before.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Google docs overwrites stuff, and I have lost things. Git saves everything

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

   Google Docs only stores files and isn't really designed for code.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Diff allows for seeing changes. I need to learn about Log.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can always go back and have an old version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to try to use it for running programs.
